== Sweet Authoring Experience

If you'd like a very pleasant authoring experience, the project provides build files that make it possible. First of all,
you'll need to run `gradlew` once. After running it once, you can run `./gradlew watch` to watch for any changes and
recompile files as you save them.

To have a similar awesome experience (watch and auto-reload) in your browser, install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] on your machine.

After installing Node, you can run the following command to install development tools (like http://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync]).
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in `package.json`.

----
npm install
----

This project use http://gulpjs.com/[Gulp] as the client-code build system. You can install the `gulp` command-line
tool globally with:

----
npm install -g gulp-cli
----

Now you can run the following `gulp` command to create a blissful development experience where your browser auto-refreshes
when files change on your hard drive.

----
gulp
----
